Welcome
========

The goal of this project is to design and develop software
prototypes for the simulation and the visualization of dynamic flows in networks.

The software **network_viz** is a first software prototype developed for the visualization of
dynamic equilibria from time varying flows.

A start guide and general documentation to use this software are available in this website.
