Welcome
========

The goal of this project is to design and develop software
prototypes for the simulation and the visualization of dynamic flows in networks.

The software **network_viz** is a first software prototype developed for the visualization of
dynamic equilibria from time varying flows.

A quick start guide to use this software, and general documentation,
will be available in this website (currently under development).
