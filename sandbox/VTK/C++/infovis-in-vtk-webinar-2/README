This directory contains examples for the Infovis in VTK webinar,
which is available here:

Due to the use of some newer features, the code requires a development
build of the VTK master branch (as of March 4, 2013).

The domains and olympics examples can be used directly as in-source
builds (i.e. the CMake build directory is the same as the source
directory). You can also do out-of-source builds if you manually copy
the .csv data files into the build directory.
